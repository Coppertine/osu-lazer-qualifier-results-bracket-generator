  ## Description:
  - This project was built to provide an easy way for anyone to create a bracket.json file for their tournament running on the osu! Lazer tournament client.
  - Without this program, either users must write their own custom script for exporting qualifier results into osu! Lazer, or they must input all results manually. The first solution is very technically challenging, while the manual entry can take upwards of 10 hours for large tournaments. This program solves this problem in a matter of seconds once installed properly.
  - During the course of writing this program, I refreshed much of my knowledge on CLIs, proper commenting and documentation, and file structure.
  - This project is, to my knowledge, the only open source and publicly available osu! Lazer tournament client script for importing qualifier results. It is also fully customizable to any tournament with a qualifier mappool; team size, qualifier pool structure, and mod pool sizes are all left up to the user.

  ## Installation:
  - If you do not have a program which can run CLI apps installed, first install one. I recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for Windows users.
  - Make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed in VSCode after downloading it. I recommend installing the LTS build recommended for most users.
  - If you have git installed, clone the repo onto your drive.![clone the repo onto your drive](https://i.imgur.com/5SX5L8h.png)
  - If you do not have git installed, download a zip file of this repo.![download a zip file of this repo](https://i.imgur.com/oBaM6JE.png)
  - Open a terminal in the project folder in your code editor.
  - In the terminal, type `npm i`. Then hit enter.
  - Add your `maps.csv` and `scores.csv` files to the `/db` folder. For the structure of these files, see [Usage](#usage).
  - You are now ready to run the program!
