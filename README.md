  ## Description:
  - This project was built to provide an easy way for anyone to create a bracket.json file for their tournament running on the osu! Lazer tournament client.
  - Without this program, either users must write their own custom script for exporting qualifier results into osu! Lazer, or they must input all results manually. The first solution is very technically challenging, while the manual entry can take upwards of 10 hours for large tournaments. This program solves this problem in a matter of seconds once installed properly.
  - During the course of writing this program, I refreshed much of my knowledge on CLIs, proper commenting and documentation, and file structure.
  - This project is, to my knowledge, the only open source and publicly available osu! Lazer tournament client script for importing qualifier results. It is also fully customizable to any tournament with a qualifier mappool; team size, qualifier pool structure, and mod pool sizes are all left up to the user.
